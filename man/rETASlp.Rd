\description{
This function simulates a spatio-temporal ETAS
(Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence) process on a linear network.
It is firstly introduced ans employed for simulation studies in D'Angelo et al. (2021).

It follows the generating scheme for simulating a pattern from an
Epidemic Type Aftershocks-Sequences (ETAS) process
(Ogata and Katsura 1988) with conditional intensity function (CIF) as in
Adelfio and Chiodi (2020), adapted for the space location of events
to be constrained on a linear network.

The simulation on the network is guaranteed by the homogeneous spatial
Poisson processes being generated on the network.

See the 'Details' section.

\details{
The CIF of an ETAS
process as in Adelfio and Chiodi (2020) can be written as \deqn{
  \lambda_{\theta}(t,\textbf{u}|\mathcal{H}_t)=\mu f(\textbf{u})+\sum_{t_j<t} \frac{\kappa_0 \exp(\eta_j)}{(t-t_j+c)^p} \{    (\textbf{u}-\textbf{u}_j)^2+d   \}^{-q}  ,
} where

\eqn{\mathcal{H}_t} is the past history of the process up to time
\eqn{t}

\eqn{\mu} is the large-scale general intensity

\eqn{f(\textbf{u})} is
the spatial density

\eqn{\eta_j=\boldsymbol{\beta}' \textbf{Z}_j} is a linear predictor

\eqn{\textbf{Z}_j} the external known covariate vector, including the
magnitude

\eqn{\boldsymbol{\theta}= (\mu, \kappa_0, c, p, d, q, \boldsymbol{\beta})}
are the parameters to be estimated

\eqn{\kappa_0} is a
normalising constant

\eqn{c} and \eqn{p} are characteristic parameters of the
seismic activity of the given region,

 and \eqn{d} and \eqn{q} are two parameters
related to the spatial influence of the mainshock

In the usual ETAS
model for seismic analyses, the only external covariate represents the magnitude,
\eqn{\boldsymbol{\beta}=\alpha}, as
\eqn{\eta_j = \boldsymbol{\beta}' \textbf{Z}_j = \alpha (m_j-m_0)}, where
\eqn{m_j} is the magnitude of the \eqn{j^{th}} event and \eqn{m_0} the threshold
magnitude, that is, the lower bound for which earthquakes with higher
values of magnitude are surely recorded in the catalogue.
